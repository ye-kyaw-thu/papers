This is my father's article relating to an old Rakhine bell (originally a Bamar bell) currently  
located in a Hindu temple, Nadrai, Uttar Pradesh, India.  
The article was published at Vol 1.1, No. 232, the Sun Rays journal (12 Jan 2019).   
Actually, in December 2018, my father and I tried to find this bell in India and it was a tough and long trip.  

Thank you very much to everyone who helped us both in Myanmar and India!  

I hope my father health is OK for writing his new book.
